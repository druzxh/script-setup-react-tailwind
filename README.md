- Node.js (Recommended version: 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Bash (Unix shell)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or create a new folder where you want to set up the React app.
2. Place the provided script file (`setup.sh`) in the root directory.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the following command:

   If prompted, provide a name for your project. If left empty, it will use the current directory name as the project name.
2. The script will create a React app using Vite, install Tailwind CSS, configure Tailwind, set up React Router, and provide a basic sample component for testing.

## Technologies Used
